Edge AI solutions are about bringing intelligence to devices where latency, power, and reliability matter most. My work focuses on deploying efficient models to embedded systems and IoT devices so they can perform real-time inference without a cloud dependency.

If you want to discuss an edge AI deployment or collaboration, reach out via [the contact section](/#contact).
